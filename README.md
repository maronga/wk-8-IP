# Predicting-Hypothyroidism-Python-Project

Predicting Hypothyroidism: Python Project IP Week 8 Core

#### {IP WEEK 8 DATA SCIENCE CORE}, {February, 2022}

#### By **{John Maronga}**

## Description

* Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism.

* The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. 

* Dataset link: http://bit.ly/hypothyroid_data
 
* I will act as their Data Scientist to build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.


## Experimental Design

* Loading & Viewing the Data
* Data Cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis:
      - Univariate
      - Bivariate
      - Multivariate
* Feature Engineering
* Modelling:
      - Random Forest Classifier
      - Ada Boost Classifier
      - Gradient Boosting Classifier
      - Support Vector Classifier
* Tuning the best model
* Challenge the solution
* Conclusion

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Google colab/jupyter notebook
* Python basics
* Python libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit learn)
* Github
